🔍 Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning
🧠 Breast Cancer Classification Using ML 
This project presents an end-to-end machine learning solution for classifying breast cancer tumors as Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

The goal is to help in early diagnosis through accurate classification models trained on real-world medical data.

🔍 Project Highlights:
Domain: Healthcare

Target Variable: diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🧪 Workflow Steps:
Data Collection from Kaggle

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

Model Building using:

✅ Random Forest Classifier

✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation using accuracy, classification report & confusion matrix

Result Summary and comparison of both models

📈 Outcome:
Achieved ~97% accuracy with Random Forest and ~96% with SVM

Demonstrated strong model performance on real medical diagnosis data
